As we worked to try to achieve justice for Abuka's family, we came to the realization that while many people respond in powerful ways to brutal police killings and other egregious incidents, handling each case separately is not an effective way to deal with police brutality. Reinventing the wheel with each new case is reactive, not proactive, and almost assures there will be more cases. It was time to form an organization to take on police brutality 24/7/365 and to work on day-to-day abuses with the idea that taking them on could reduce the number of more serious incidents. In mid-December 2000, CUAPB held its first meeting on a Saturday at Hosmer Library in Minneapolis."

We have seeded and served as an incubator to trailblazing organizations like Critical Resistance, Justice Now, California Coalition for Women Prisoners, Prison Activist Resource Center and more. We have litigated dozens of cases resulting in trendsetting legal standards including expanding alternatives to incarceration, ending long term solitary confinement in California, and the protection of pregnant incarcerated women.

Stemming from her family's circumstances and a desire to change state and federal policies that allow for the prosecution of hundreds of thousands of youth in adult court every year, this parent made a financial commitment to launch a national campaign. Subsequently, the Campaign for Youth Justice officially opened in July, 2005.

  The strategic goals of CFYJ are to reduce the total number of youth prosecuted in the adult criminal justice system and to decrease the harmful impact of trying youth in adult court. The campaign utilizes both federal and state-level strategies for youth justice reform. We strongly believe that any movement must involve those who are most impacted by the laws and policies. Thus, we seek to empower those affected by encouraging them to use their voices and experiences to affect meaningful change."

  description: "This book attempts to spark public discussion by revealing the tainted origins of modern policing as a tool of social control. It shows how the expansion of police authority is inconsistent with community empowerment, social justice—even public safety. Drawing on groundbreaking research from across the world, and covering virtually every area in the increasingly broad range of police work, Alex Vitale demonstrates how law enforcement has come to exacerbate the very problems it is supposed to solve.")

It is the ways that we practice language that differentiate us from one group to another. Just like accents connote where one comes from, so too do the words and slang that we practice in everyday speech. In today’s pop culture, black slang has become the social capital for differentiating who is socially “in” and who is “out.” Words like “woke,” “rachet,” “twerk,” and “basic” have become common sayings that are often misused or overly emphasized in order for people to feel cool or aware. But these words, while seemingly accepted by society today, mark a key misstep in how white America perceives itself in relation to the continued marginalization of the black communities of the US. In many ways, the use of black slang is a marker of the continued commodification of black art and culture that is used to legitimize and benefit the white majority.")
